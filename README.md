# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting customer churn in a telecom dataset using Python and scikit-learn — all inside a single Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, we build a model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their service usage and demographic information.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `CustomerChurnPortfolioNotebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data preprocessing and encoding
  - Feature scaling
  - Model training (Random Forest)
  - Evaluation (classification report & confusion matrix)
  - Feature importance visualization
  - Model saving (`joblib`)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (RandomForest, GridSearchCV)
- joblib (for model saving)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the notebook
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CustomerChurnPortfolioNotebook.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Sample Output

- Classification accuracy on test data
- Feature importance chart
- Confusion matrix heatmap

## 💼 Use Case

This project is ideal for showcasing machine learning skills in:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Supervised learning
- Model evaluation & interpretation
